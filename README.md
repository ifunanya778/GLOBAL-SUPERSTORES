## Data Cleaning and Transformation
The dataset was imported into power bi as a csv file, it contain three tables which are Order,People,Return. I upload the dataset into power query editor to changed all null values under profit column to zero so as to get an accurate total result.I also used first column as header rows in people and return table all this resulted to a clean and transformed data ready for visualization and analysis.
