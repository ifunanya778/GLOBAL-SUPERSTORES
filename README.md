## Problem Statement
1.Identify the three countries with the highest total profit in 2014 and the top 3 most profitable products in these countries.

2.Identify the top 3 subcategories with the highest average shipping cost in United States.

3.Compare Nigeria's profitability in 2014 with other African countries and analyze the factors for it's poor perfomance looking at shipping cost and average discount rate as  factors.

4.Identify the least profitable product subcategory in Southeast Asia and which specific country should this product be discontinued.

5.Identify the cities with more than or equal to ten orders which is the least profitable by average profit in United States and why is this city's average profit so low.

6.Which product subcategory has the highest average profit in Australia.

7.Identify the most valuable customers and what do they purchase.

## Data Cleaning and Transformation
The dataset was imported into power bi as a csv file, it contain three tables which are Order,People,Return. I upload the dataset into power query editor to changed all null values under profit column to zero so as to get an accurate total result.I also used first column as header rows in people and return table all this resulted to a clean and transformed data ready for visualization and analysis.
